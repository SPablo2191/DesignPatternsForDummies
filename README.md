## What is a Pattern Design?
- pre-made blueprints that you can apply in order to solver design problem in your code.
- it is not a "ctrl+c ctrl+v" type of solution
- the pattern is a concept for solving a particular problem.
- it is not algorithm => this one is like a cooking recipe (step by step)
- meanwhile, PD is like a blue print => this beautiful tool helps you in a high level description of a solution (you apply the idea in base of this)
- typical solutions to common problems in object-oriented design.
- toolkit of tried and tested solutions to common problems.

## Classification of patterns
- creational:
    - object creation mechanisms => allow to reuse the code
- structural:
    - assemble objectsd and classes into larger structures 
- behavioral:
    - effective communication between objects.
